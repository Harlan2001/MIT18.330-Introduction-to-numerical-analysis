Consider a Runge--Kutta method starting at $(t_n, x_n)$ that takes an Euler step\nof length $h/2$ to $(t_{n+1/2}, x_{n+1/2})$ and then uses the new evaluation\nat that point to take a complete Euler step from $(t_n, x_n)$\nof length $h$.\n\n    Find the order of this method and write down its Butcher tableau. We will refer to it as the \"midpoint method\".\n\n2. Define a type `RKMethod` to represent a general explicit Runge--Kutta method defined by a [Butcher tableau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods#Explicit_Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods) as follows:\n\n    ```jl\n    struct RKMethod{T}\n        c::Vector{T}\n        b::Vector{T}\n        a::Matrix{T}\n        s::Int  # number of stages\n    end\n    ```\n\n    Make it into a function by completing the function\n\n    ```jl\n    function (method::RKMethod)(f, x, t, h)\n        ...\n    end\n    ```\n\n    to execute one step of the corresponding Runge--Kutta method with initial condition $x$ at time $t$ and step size $h$. Your code should work for both scalar and vector $x$ and a possibly vector-valued function $f = f(t, x)$ (Assume that $a$ is a lower-triangular matrix, corresponding to an explicit method.)\n\n\n3. Define RK methods `euler`, `midpoint` and `RK4` using their respective tableaus.\n\n4. Write a routine `integrate` with the signature\n\n    ```\n    function integrate(method, f, x0, t0, t_final, h)\n    ```\n\n    where `method` is a RK method as defined above and $h$ is a fixed step size.\n\n    Make sure that the final step lands exactly at the final time by taking that final step as a special case.\n\n\n5. Use each method on the ODE $\\dot{x} = 1.5x$ with $x_0 = 2$ and integrate from $t=0$ for a time $t_\\text{final} = 3$.\n\n    Find the rate of convergence of the numerical solution to the exact solution as $h \\to 0$ for each method. Do they correspond to our analytical expectations?\n\n6. Even Runge--Kutta methods may not be good enough without adaptivity: consider the ODE\n\n    $$\\dot{u}(t) = \\exp \\left[t - u \\, \\sin(u) \\right].$$\n\n    Integrate it using RK4 from $t=0$ to $t=5$ with a step size $h=10^{-2}$. Now integrate it with a step size $h = 10^{-3}$.\n\n    Plot both solutions $x(t)$ as a function of $t$.\n    What do you observe? What do you think is happening?\n\n\n\n### Exercise 2: Adaptivity in the Euler method\n\nIn this exercise we will invetigate adaptivity in ODE solvers by taking the simplest case: an adaptive Euler method.\n\n1. Consider one step of the Euler method. Write down the local (single-step) error in terms of the step size $h$ and the unknown constant $C$. Call the approximation obtained at the end of the step $x^{(1)}$.\n\n2. Now consider taking two consecutive Euler steps of size $h/2$. Would you expect this to give a better or a worse approximation to the true solution? Write down the total error after taking the two steps, assuming that the constant $C$ is the same for both. Call the approximation at the end of this combined step $x^{(2)}$.\n\n3. Define $\\Delta x$ as the difference between the two approximations. Use this to find the step size $h'$ that will give an error per unit time of a given size $\\epsilon$.\n\n4. Use this derivation to write an adaptive Euler integrator `adaptive_euler(f, t0, t_final, epsilon)` that tries to keep the global error less than $\\epsilon$, using an update rule similar to the one we discussed in class. Add a multiplicative factor $0.9$ to that rule to make the method behave better.\n\n5. Use it to integrate the same ODE as in exercise 1. Plot\nthe step size taken as a function of time.\n\n6. Now integrate the equation for the van der Pol oscillator:\n\n    $$\n    \\ddot{x} -\\mu (1-x^{2}) \\dot{x} + x = 0,\n    $$\n    with $\\mu = 5$. Use initial conditions $x_0 = 0$ and $\\dot{x}_0 = 1$.\n\n7. Plot trajectories in $(x, \\dot{x})$ phase space and (separately) the solution $x(t)$ as a function of $t$.\n\n8. Plot the step size as a function of time. What do you observe? How do you interpret this?\n\n\n#### Exercise 3: SIR model\n\nIn this exercise we will study the SIR model of the dynamics of an infectious disease outbreak (\"epidemic\") in a population.\n\n1. Use e.g. RK4 to solve the SIR equations:\n\n    \\begin{align}\n    \\dot{S} &= -\\beta S \\, I \\\\\n    \\dot{I} &= \\beta S \\, I  - \\gamma I \\\\\n    \\dot{R} &= \\gamma I\n    \\end{align}\n\n    Here $I$ is the proportion of the population which is infectious.  $\\beta$ is the rate of contact between susceptible and infectious individuals, and $\\gamma$ the recovery rate.\n\n    Use $S_0 = 0.99$ and $I_0 = 0.01$.\n\n2.  Make an interactive visualization, varying $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ in, say, the range $0$ to $1$.\n\n3. What do you observe? Can you interpret this?\n\n4. By summing the equations we see that $S + I + R$ should be constant (equal to the total population, assuming no births or deaths).\nFor representative parameter values $\\beta = 0.1$ and $\\gamma = 0.05$, how well does the numerics conserve this quantity?"
