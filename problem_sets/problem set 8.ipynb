    "### Exercise 1 : Eigenvalue solvers for a special matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem we will consider a very special symmetric matrix. Recall that the second-order finite difference scheme for a function $f(x)$ is given by\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f''_n = \\frac{f_{n+1}  - 2 f_n + f_{n-1}}{h^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $f_n = f(x_0 + nh)$ and $h = \\frac{x_N - x_0}{N}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define the vector $\\mathbf{f}$ such that $\\mathbf{f}_n = f_n$. Then the corresponding derivative vector using finite differences can be written as $\\mathbf{f}'' = D \\mathbf{f}$. Some care must be taken about the boundary conditions; for simplicity we will assume that $f_0 = f_N = 0$. Under these assumptions the matrix $D$ is a tridiagonal matrix:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix} f'_1 \\\\ f'_2 \\\\ f'_3 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ f'_{N-2} \\\\ f'_{N-1}\\end{bmatrix} =\n",
    "\\underbrace{\\begin{bmatrix} -2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -2 &  1\\\\ & 1 & -2 & 1 \\\\ && \\ddots & \\ddots& \\ddots \\\\ &&& 1& -2 &1 \\\\ &&&& 1& -2\\end{bmatrix}}_{D_N} \\begin{bmatrix} f_1 \\\\ f_2 \\\\ f_3 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ f_{N-2} \\\\ f_{N-1}\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "You can construct the matrix $D$ in Julia using the `diagm` function. For simplicity keep everything dense in this problem, although there clearly a lot of structure that could be exploited.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Consider the matrix $D$. Using the ansatz (i.e. hypothesis) $\\mathbf{v}_n = \\sin(\\pi n k/N)$, where $1 \\le k \\le N-1$, show that $\\mathbf{v}$ is an eigenvector of $D_N$. What is the corresponding eigenvalue? Remember that the eigenvalues should be real!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In class we discussed several ways to find eigenvalues of matrices. The simplest algorithm for finding eigenvalues is the **power method**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Supppse that a symmetric matrix $A$ has the eigendecomposition $A = X \\Lambda X^{-1}$. Recall that for a symmetric matrix the eigenvectors associated with distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal. Starting with a random intitial vector $\\mathbf{x}$  which can be written as a sum over the eigenvectors,\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\\mathbf{x} = \\sum_n c_n \\mathbf{v}_n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    show that\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$A^k \\mathbf{x} = \\sum_n \\lambda_n^k c_n \\mathbf{v}_n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    where we order the eigenvalues by their magnitude, $|\\lambda_1| > |\\lambda_2| > \\cdots >  |\\lambda_N|$ and hence\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$ A^k \\mathbf{x} = c_1 \\lambda_1^k \\left( \\mathbf{v}_1 + \\mathcal{O}\\left( \\textstyle \\frac{\\lambda_2^k}{\\lambda_1^k} \\mathbf{v}_2\\right)\\right) .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    This shows why the power method converges to the leading eigenvector.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The power method gives an *approximation* for the leading eigenvector $\\tilde{\\mathbf{v}}_1$. Since it is only an approximation it is not necessarily true that $A \\tilde{\\mathbf{v}}_1 = \\lambda_1 \\tilde{\\mathbf{v}}_1$ exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Instead we will say that the best approximation to $\\lambda_1$ is given by the $\\lambda$ that satifies\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$ \\lambda_1 = \\min_{\\alpha} || A\\tilde{\\mathbf{v}}_1 - \\alpha \\tilde{\\mathbf{v}}_1 ||^2 = \\sum_i \\left( \\sum_k A_{ik} (\\tilde{\\mathbf{v}}_1)_k - \\alpha (\\tilde{\\mathbf{v}}_1)_i\\right)^2.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    By differentiating this expression with respect to $\\alpha$, show that\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\lambda_1 \\approx \\frac{\\tilde{\\mathbf{v}}_1 \\cdot (A\\tilde{\\mathbf{v}}_1)}{\\tilde{\\mathbf{v}}_1 \\cdot \\tilde{\\mathbf{v}}_1} = \\frac{\\tilde{\\mathbf{v}}_1^\\top A \\tilde{\\mathbf{v}}_1}{\\tilde{\\mathbf{v}}_1^\\top \\tilde{\\mathbf{v}}_1}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    This is called the **Rayleigh quotient**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Implement the power method `power_method(A, N, x)` for a symmetric matrix $A$ which iterates for a fixed number of iterations $N$ on the intial vector `x` and returns $\\tilde{\\mathbf{v}}_1$ and $\\lambda_1$ approximated by the Rayleigh quotient above.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Run this on the matrix $D_{10}$ which is of size $(9 \\times 9)$. Use the true largest *magnitude* vector from part 1. Plot the relative error between your result and the true value as a function of $N$ to get a smooth plot; use the same initial vector each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Remember to normalize the vector at each iteration to avoid overflow! This initial random vector should be complex. (Extra credit: show that the relationship is what you would expect analytically!)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. A more advanced method that we discussed to find all the eigenvalues was the QR algorithm. We define $A^{(0)} = A$ and then\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    \\begin{align*}\n",
    "    Q^{(k)} R^{(k)} &= A^{(k)} \\\\\n",
    "    A^{(k+1)} &= R^{(k)}Q^{(k)}\n",
    "    \\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    This will normally converge to an upper-triangular matrix. How does this work? We call two matrices $A$ and $B$ **similar** if $B = Q A Q^\\top$ where $Q$ is orthogonal. Show that if $A$ has eigenvalue pairs $(\\lambda_i, \\mathbf{v}_i)$ then $B$ has eigenpairs $(\\lambda_i, Q \\mathbf{v}_i)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Show that in the QR algorithm $A^{(k+1)}$ is similar to $A^{(k)}$ and hence $A$. Therefore if the algorithm converges to an upper-triangular matrix we can read off the eigenvalues from the diagonal and the eigenvectors will be given by the columns of $Q^{(1)} Q^{(2)} Q^{(3)} \\cdots Q^{(N)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Implement the QR algorithm in a function `qr_algorithm(A, N)` for a matrix $A$ with $N$ iterations. It should return the resulting matrix $A^{(l)}$ and the eigenvector matrix. Run the algorithm on a random symmetric matrix of size $10 \\times 10$ for $100$ iterations. How close to upper-triangular is the resulting matrix?\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Run the QR algorithm on the matrix $D_{10}$ of size $(9 \\times 9)$ for a suitable number of iterations to get convergence. Compare the results to the theoretical one. Can you find all the eigenvalues and eigenvectors?\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Using the fact that the eigendecomposition of a symmetric matrix gives orthogonal matrices (which are easy to invert) propose a method to solve the linear system\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$ D \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Solve the system for `b = 0.01^2*sin.(2π*(0.01:0.01:0.99))` and $D$ as a $99 \\times 99$ matrix. Plot the resulting vector $\\mathbf{x}$. Plot on the same axis `sin.(2π*(0.01:0.01:0.99))/4π^2`. Is it similar to $\\mathbf{x}$? We have just solved the boundary value problem $f'' = \\sin(2\\pi x)$ with $f(0) = f(2\\pi) = 0$. In the next problem set we will see how to do this even quicker using Fourier analysis."

    "\n",
    "3. Remembering that the rank is the column rank, i.e. the number of linearly-independent columns, how much should the rank be? Use the SVD of `M` to confirm this. What does the rank-1 approximation of `M` look like?\n",

    "6. Plot the magnitude of $\\hat{f}_n$ as a function of $n$ for the two functions. How do the coefficients decay? Is this what you expected?"
