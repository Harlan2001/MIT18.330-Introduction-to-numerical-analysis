# 18.330: Introduction to numerical analysis

The powerful computing power of computer helps people constantly break the boundary in the field of science. However, there is a natural gap between the discrete nature of computer and the continuous world, and how to estimate and approximate those mathematically continuous concepts with discrete representation is an important topic in numerical analysis.

This course will discuss various numerical analysis methods in floating point representation, equation solving, linear algebra, calculus, differential equation and other fields, and let you repeatedly understand a series of steps in Julia's programming practice: (1) how to establish estimation, (2) how to estimate error, and (3) how to achieve estimation by algorithm.

The designer of this course has also written an accompanying open source textbook with rich examples of Julia.
